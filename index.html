        <h1>How They Met</h1>
        <p>How they met. The couple's first meeting was on May 13, 2022. 
            Their meeting was through their work at the Children's Adventure Center where Austin trained Rachel. 
            That day they both went home telling their families about the cute person they met that day. 
            Overtime they would see each other at work and try to slip in as many conversations possible. 
            After this went on a while In mid July Austin finally got the guts to ask Rachel out. 
            As you can guess, it was a yes! That night they went and watched Top Gun Maverick, 
            got some Chick-fil-a, and sat in the car talking for hours. 
            From that point on the relationship grew, Constantly texting and going out when they could. 
            On the first Tuesday in August Austin asked Rachel to be his girlfriend. 
            Caught off guard Rachel said she needed to pray on it. During this waiting period Austin was very anxious. 
            So much so he got physically ill with anxiety. Worrying he might lose her. 
            That Saturday she invited him over to her place and give him the news, she would be his girlfriend!
            Austin was very relieved. From that point on they got together as much as they could and got to know each other well. 
            When September rolled around they both knew that they wanted to get married! They went and found a ring. 
            From there it was a waiting game. The ring being custom made took almost a month to arrive. 
            By the time it came they had set up their sealing in the temple and a venue. 
            There at the venue they chose, being the Arbor, Austin surprised Rachel and proposed to her. 
            Now they get to live together for eternity in joy as they work together to learn and grow.
